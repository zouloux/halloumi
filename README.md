# Pasta Devops üçù

## About

**Pasta** is a minimalist set of scripts and conventions to host docker applications on **Debian based VPS servers**.

It manages **sud-domains routing** and **automatic SSL generation** thanks to [Nginx proxy](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy) and [acme-companion](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/acme-companion).

You can install **dockerized applications** and **deploy git based projects** effortlessly through CI scripts.

It's **SSH based** for admin, and comes with a **node package** for git projects CI management.

#### TLDR

- [Go to server install script](#install-pasta-server)

## Features

With those script and conventions, you will be able to :
- Host and run docker applications
- Host your projects git repositories ( with Gitea or Gitlab )
- Host and run staging project ( projects you are working on )
- Deploy with CI to a production server

**But also :**
- Sync projects dynamic files between envs ( data files, user generated content )
- Create secured workspaces for any project to work with other developers
- Deploy specific branches of your git projects with 0s downtime

## Elements

- **Pasta Server** - Script and conventions to manage docker on any Debian VPS
- **Pasta Node** - Node package to manage CI
