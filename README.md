# Halloumi ðŸ§€

## TLDR

```shell
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zouloux/halloumi/main/setup.sh)
```

## About

**Halloumi** is a minimalist set of scripts and conventions to host docker applications on **Debian VPS servers**.

It manages automatically sud-domains routing and SSL generation thanks to [Nginx proxy](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy) and [acme-companion](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/acme-companion).

#### Features

With those script and conventions, you will be able to :
- Host and run docker applications
- Host your projects git repositories ( with Gitea )
- Host and run staging project ( projects you are working on )
- Deploy with CI to a production server

**But also :**
- Sync projects dynamic files between servers ( databases, user generated content )
- Create secured user spaces for any project to work with other developers

#### Dependencies

**The setup will install :**
- docker
- git
- logrotate ( to minimize log file size ) - preconfigured
- apache2-utils ( for password management )
- rsync ( for host <-> remote file transfer )
- [htop](https://github.com/htop-dev/htop?tab=readme-ov-file)
- [lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker)

> All other dependencies will be managed through docker applications

#### Bash config

Halloumi comes with a nice [.bashrc](./.bashrc) which shows the current user and server to avoid critical mistakes.

#### Aliases helpers

- `quick-download $file` - Download a file from the current working directory through iterm2
- `rsync-download $file` - Create a rsync command to run on your host to download a remote file
- `rsync-upload $file` - Create a rsync command to run on your host to upload a local file
- `docker-restart` - Restart docker compose project in cwd and follow logs
- `docker-clean` - Prune docker system

**But also**
- `htop` - Check process and resources ( clickable interface )
- `lazydocker` - Manage docker containers ( clickable interface )
- `l` / `ll` - Colored shortcut for `ls`
