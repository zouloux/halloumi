# Update Halloumi

**This will update :**
- `~/scripts` ( override ),
- `~/.bashrc` ( with a `.old` backup if different )
- `~/containers/services/proxy/docker-compose.yaml` ( with a `.old` backup if different )

> The nginx server will be stopped while update, so all service all be inaccessible.

> If you made any change to scripts located in `~/scripts`, those changes will be overridden
 
> If you changed the proxy's `docker-compose.yaml` or your `.bashrc` file, you will have to manually merge the modifications with the updated file.


On your VPS instance :
```bash
~/scripts/halloumi-update.sh
```
