# Prepare VPS network for Pasta Server

Basically we will point a domain and all its first-level sub-domains to your VPS instance.

#### Choose new SSH port

For security reasons, we can change the default port from `22` to `2XXX`.
Choose a number between `2000` and `2999` and note it aside.
It will also allow Gitea on master servers to have git on `22`.

#### Connect to VPS admin panel

1. Create IPV6 address ( needed on Ionos )
2. Setup reverse DNS on ip addresses ( set as root domain )
3. Open the new SSH port the firewall ( TCP only is enough, origin `0.0.0.0` )

#### DNS admin panel

Go to your DNS registar admin panel, and add those 4 lines to the DNS registry :

**Root domain :**
- `A {ipv4} @`
- `AAAA {ipv6} @`

**All 1st level sub-domains :**
- `A {ipv4} *`
- `AAAA {ipv6} *`

> On some DNS providers, the `@` is simply a `.`

#### How to test

You can use the command `dig` to check if everything is correctly configured.
