# Prepare VPS network for Halloumi

Point a domain and its sub-domains to your VPS instance. 

#### VPS admin panel

You should now be able to connect to your VPS admin panel
1. Create IPV6 address ( needed on Ionos )
2. Setup reverse DNS on ip addresses ( set as root domain )
3. Open a new port for SSH on the firewall ( greater than 2000 and not used by other services )

#### DNS admin panel

Go to your registar admin panel, and add those 4 lines to the DNS registry :

**Root domain :**
- `A {ipv4} @`
- `AAAA {ipv6} @`

**All 1st level sub-domains :**
- `A {ipv4} *`
- `AAAA {ipv6} *`

> On some DNS providers, the `@` is simply a `.`
