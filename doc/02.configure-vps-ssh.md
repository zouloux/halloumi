## Configure SSH

#### Install public SSH
Copy your ssh public key from your computer, and paste it on the VPS at `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

#### Change SSH port

On your VPS
```bash
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Change port to the port you selected before
```
Port {newPort}
PasswordAuthentication no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
```

Delete the default password ( Ionos only )
```bash
rm /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-cloud-init.conf
```

Restart SSH and exit
```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
exit
```

#### Test security

Check if old port is disabled ( should fail ) :
```bash
ssh root@{domain}
```

Check if password disabled ( should fail ) :
```bash
ssh -p {newPort} -o PreferredAuthentications=password root@{domain}
```

Reconnect through the new port ( should work ) :
```bash
ssh -p {newPort} root@{domain}
```

#### Stuck outside ?

- Try to access recovery console on your VPS provider
- If not working, add a virtual recovery disk and mount `/dev/sda1`
- Start from a fresh installation if you have no important file
