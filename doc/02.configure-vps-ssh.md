## Configure SSH

## Automatic installation

I created a script to automate this, run it at your own risks :

```bash
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zouloux/pasta/main/prepare.sh)
```

## Manual installation

#### Install public SSH
Copy your ssh public key from your computer, and paste it on the VPS at `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

#### Change SSH port

On your VPS
```bash
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Change port to the port you selected before.
```
Port {newPort}
PasswordAuthentication no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
```

Delete the default password ( Ionos only )
```bash
rm /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-cloud-init.conf
```

Restart SSH and exit
```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
exit
```

## Test security

Check if old port is disabled ( should fail ) :
```bash
ssh root@{domain}
```

Check if password disabled ( should fail ) :
```bash
ssh -p {newPort} -o PreferredAuthentications=password root@{domain}
```

Reconnect through the new port ( should work ) :
```bash
ssh -p {newPort} root@{domain}
```

## Stuck outside ?

- Try to access recovery console on your VPS provider
- Try to select other SSH keys ( `ssh -p $port -I $privateKeyFile` ... )
- If not working, add a virtual recovery disk and mount `/dev/sda1`
- If not working, start from a fresh installation if you have no important file
