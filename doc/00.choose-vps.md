# Choose your VPS for a new Halloumi Instance

## Buy your VPS

First, buy your VPS server ( tested on )
- [Ionos](https://www.ionos.fr/serveurs/vps) 👍
- Hostinger 👍
- ~~OVH~~ 👎 ( works but bad experience )

## Operating System

**Halloumi is tested on Debian 12.** but should work on other Debian versions and Ubuntu.
We advise using Debian because it has every needed features and use less resources.

## Select the correct amount of resources

#### For master servers ( with gitea and project previews )
- At least 2gb or 4gb will be required
- At least 120gb of SSD storage
- 2 or 4 cpus

#### For production servers
It can start safely at **1cpu + 1gb + 10gb** for basic websites, but select carefully depending on the installed applications.
