## About

**Pasta** is a minimalist set of scripts and conventions to host docker applications on **Debian based VPS servers**.

It manages **sud-domains routing** and **automatic SSL generation** thanks to [Nginx proxy](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy) and [acme-companion](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/acme-companion).

You can install **dockerized applications** and **deploy git based projects** effortlessly through CI scripts.

It's **SSH based** for admin, and comes with a **node package** for git projects CI management.
