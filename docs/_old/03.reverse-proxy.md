# Pasta Server reverse proxy

- Routing from `your-app.your-domain.com` to the correct container is handled by [Nginx Proxy](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy)
- Automatic SSL generation and renewal for secured HTTPS connexion is handled by [Acme Companion](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/acme-companion)
- [Nginx Proxy documentation](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy/tree/main/docs)

## Routing

It works by setting `VIRTUAL_HOST` as an `environment` variable in `docker-compose.yaml`

## Example of manual application routing

```yaml
# Pasta network is shared between all containers that need to be exposed publicly and the reverse proxy
networks:
  pasta:
    external: true

services:
  frontend:
    image: "frontend"
    environment:
      # Will route umami.your-domain.com to this container
      VIRTUAL_HOST: "my-project.$PASTA_DOMAIN"
      # Will generate and maintain SSL certificates for HTTPS connexion
      LETSENCRYPT_HOST: "my-project.$PASTA_DOMAIN"
      # Link port 80 and 443 of the reverse proxy to a specific port inside the container
      VIRTUAL_PORT: 3000
      # Need to connect to proxied network
      networks:
        - "pasta"

  backend:
    image: "backend"
    environment:
      # Will route umami.your-domain.com to this container
      VIRTUAL_HOST: "my-project.$PASTA_DOMAIN"
      # Will generate and maintain SSL certificates for HTTPS connexion
      LETSENCRYPT_HOST: "my-project.$PASTA_DOMAIN"
      # Link port 80 and 443 of the reverse proxy to a specific port inside the container
      VIRTUAL_PORT: 3000
      # Some container can be mapped behind a specific path
      # For example backend container is on "/admin"
      VIRTUAL_PATH: "/admin"
	  # Optionally, the destination ( what the container see of the path ) can be changed
	  # Here, any request to /admin will be see as / on the admin
      VIRTUAL_DEST: "."
    networks:
      - "pasta"
```


?> In projects, `pasta.yaml` manages the `VIRTUAL_HOST` and `LETSENCRYPT_HOST` automatically for convenience, but it can be overridden in `docker-compose.pasta.yaml` of your project.
