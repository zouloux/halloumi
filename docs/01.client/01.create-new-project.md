# Create a new project locally with Pasta-CLI

## Git and CI based deployment

First, create your Git repository and clone it locally. Then :
```bash
pasta init
```

?> You should have access to a **Pasta Server** and a **[Project Workspace](00.server/03.projects/00.create-new-project)** to init a new project locally.

## Deploy from your computer - AKA Pasta Yolo

If you do not need Git based deployment and **Continuous Integration**. Then :
```bash
pasta init
```
