# Pasta Server Variables

Those variables are stored in the config directory when you install **Pasta Server**.
Every connected user will have access to all of them ( also available in scripts ).

```bash
PASTA_DOMAIN=my-domain.com
PASTA_HOSTAME=my-domain
PASTA_EMAIL=admin@my-domain.com
```

## Config files

Config Files are available here `/usr/local/pasta/config`.

?> If you change them, log-out and re-login in SSH, then restart your running docker containers.
