# Pasta Server Variables

Those variables are stored in the config directory when you install **Pasta Server**.
Every connected user will have access to all of them ( also available in scripts )

```bash
$PASTA_HOSTAME=my-domain
$PASTA_DOMAIN=my-domain.com
$PASTA_EMAIL=admin@my-domain.com
```

?> Files are available here `/usr/local/pasta/config`
