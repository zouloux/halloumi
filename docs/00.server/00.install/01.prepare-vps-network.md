# Prepare VPS network for Pasta Server

## DNS admin panel

Select a domain name that will be attached to your server.
Go to your DNS admin panel, and add those 4 lines to the DNS registry :

**Map Root domain :**
- `A {ipv4} @`
- `AAAA {ipv6} @`

**Mapp all 1st level sub-domains :**
- `A {ipv4} *`
- `AAAA {ipv6} *`

?> On some DNS providers, the `@` is simply a `.`

`my-domain.com` and `*.my-domain.com` will go to your VPS IP addresses.

#### How to test

You can use the command `dig` and `ping` to check if everything is correctly configured.
