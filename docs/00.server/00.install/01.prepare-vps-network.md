# Prepare VPS network for Pasta Server

**Things covered:**
- point a **domain and all its first-level sub-domains** to your VPS instance.


#### Connect to your hosting admin panel

1. Create IPV6 address ( needed on Ionos )
2. Setup reverse DNS on ip addresses ( set as root domain )


#### DNS admin panel

Go to your DNS admin panel, and add those 4 lines to the DNS registry :

**Root domain :**
- `A {ipv4} @`
- `AAAA {ipv6} @`

**All 1st level sub-domains :**
- `A {ipv4} *`
- `AAAA {ipv6} *`

> On some DNS providers, the `@` is simply a `.`

> `my-domain.com` and `*.my-domain.com` will go to your VPS IP address


#### How to test

You can use the command `dig` to check if everything is correctly configured.
