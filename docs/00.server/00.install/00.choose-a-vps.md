# Choose your VPS for a new Pasta Instance

## Buy your VPS

First, buy your VPS server ( tested on )
- [Ionos](https://www.ionos.fr/serveurs/vps) 👍
- Hostinger 👍
- ~~OVH~~ 👎 ( works but bad experience )

## Operating System

**Pasta Server is tested on Debian 12.** but should work on all recent **Debian and Ubuntu versions**.
We advise using Debian because it has every needed features and use few resources.

> Feel free to reach if you want to port **Pasta** on another distribution.

## Select the correct amount of resources

#### For master servers ( with gitea and project previews )
- At least 2gb will be required, 4gb is advised.
- At least 80gb of SSD storage, ~200gb+ is advised.
- At least 2 cpus, 4 cpus is advised

#### For production servers

**Pasta Production Server** will only host 1 or 2 branches of a project.
It can start safely at **1cpu + 1gb + 10gb** for basic websites without much data and no user generated content, but select carefully depending on the installed applications.
