## Configure SSH

We are going to configure SSH of your freshly installed VPS for better security and interoperability.
- **Install an SSH public key** to allow password-less access ( heavily recommended )
- Remove password access ( recommended, less automated hacks )
- Change the default port ( recommended, less automated hacks )

> You should have an SSH keypair created locally before continuing.

## Automatic installation

Run this script when connected through SSH to your VPS, you have to be `root`.

```bash
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zouloux/pasta/main/prepare.sh)
```



## Manual installation

#### Install public SSH
Copy your ssh public key from your computer, and paste it on the VPS at `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

#### Choose new SSH port

For security reasons, we can change the default port from `22` to `2XXX`.
Choose a number between `2000` and `2999`.

!> Do not forget to open this port on your VPS firewall! It's generally on your hosting admin console.

#### Change SSH port and remove password access

On your VPS
```bash
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Change port to the port you selected before.
```
Port {newPort}
PasswordAuthentication no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
```

Delete the default password ( Ionos only )
```bash
rm /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-cloud-init.conf
```

Restart SSH and exit
```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
exit
```

## Test security

Check if old port is disabled ( should fail ) :
```bash
ssh root@{domain}
```

Check if password disabled ( should fail ) :
```bash
ssh -p {newPort} -o PreferredAuthentications=password root@{domain}
```

Reconnect through the new port ( should work ) :
```bash
ssh -p {newPort} root@{domain}
```

## Stuck outside ?

- Try to access recovery console on your VPS provider
- Did you open the port on your firewall? 
- Try to select other SSH keys ( `ssh -p $port -I $privateKeyFile` ... )
- If not working, add a virtual recovery disk and mount `/dev/sda1`
- If not working, start from a fresh installation if you have no important file
