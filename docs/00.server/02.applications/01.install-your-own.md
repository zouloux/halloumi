# Install your own self-hosted application

You can self-host any dockerized application following simple rules.

- Routing from `your-app.your-domain.com` to the correct container is handled by [Nginx Proxy](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy)
- Automatic SSL generation and renewal for secured HTTPS connexion is handled by [Acme Companion](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/acme-companion)
- [Nginx Proxy documentation](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy/tree/main/docs)

## Docker Compose file

Here is an example of a required docker compose elements to start self-hosting any dockerized service.

```yaml
networks:
  pasta:
    external: true
services:
  my-service:
    image: [...]
    environment:
      VIRTUAL_HOST: "service.$PASTA_DOMAIN"
      LETSENCRYPT_HOST: "service.$PASTA_DOMAIN"
      VIRTUAL_PORT: 3000
    networks:
      - pasta
```

Put this file in :
```
/root/containers/apps/{my-service}/docker-compose.yaml
```

> Use `VIRTUAL_HOST`, `LETSENCRYPT_HOST` and `VIRTUAL_PORT` to map your services with the reverse proxy.

Start it with :
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Manage your running containers with :
```bash
lazydocker
```
