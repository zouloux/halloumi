# Portainer app on Pasta Server

Portainer helps manage running docker containers on your **Pasta Server**
Keep track of running containers, http endpoints and be notified via Slack or Email if anything goes wrong.

## How to install

- Copy [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/zouloux/pasta/tree/main/server/containers/apps/portainer-admin/docker-compose.yaml) content on your **Pasta Server** at `~/containers/apps/portainer/`

#### Start
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## How to upgrade

- `cd ~/containers/apps/portainer-admin` and `docker compose down`
- Not mandatory, but you can safely copy the `data/` directory.
- - `docker images | grep "portainer-ce"` and get the image id
- Remove the old image with `docker image rm {imageID}`
- Restart the container with the new image `docker compose up -d`
