# NetData app on Pasta Server

[NetData](https://www.netdata.cloud/) is an open-source and self-hosted performance and monitoring platform.

## How to install

- Copy [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/zouloux/pasta/tree/main/server/containers/apps/netdata/docker-compose.yaml) content on your **Pasta Server** at `~/containers/apps/netdata/`

#### Start
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## How to upgrade

- `cd ~/containers/apps/netdata` and `docker compose down`
- Not mandatory, but you can safely copy the `data/` directory.
- - `docker images | grep "netdata"` and get the image id
- Remove the old image with `docker image rm {imageID}`
- Restart the container with the new image `docker compose up -d`


#### Password

You can use the `proxy-password` command to set up an http password.

```bash
proxy-password kuma.$PASTA_DOMAIN <login:pass>
```

> Do not replace $PASTA_DOMAIN, it's a real system variable
