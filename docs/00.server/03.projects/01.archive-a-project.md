# Archive a project

After a project is finished, you can make some room on the server to keep things tidy.

```bash
project-archive <project?>
```

It will :
- shut down every running containers of every branches of this project.
- remove every built data
- create a `tar.gz` archive with keys and the `data` directory


?> You can download this archive locally with the `rsync-download <file>` command.
