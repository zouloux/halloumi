# Create a new project

Pasta Projects are created on the server with the command :

```bash
project-create <project?>
```

It's necessary to create a project on the server to be able to use the `pasta deploy` command **locally** or in **CI**.

## How it works

This command will create a new linux user and [some directories](00.server/04.more/00.file-structure?id=after-project-creation) to host the dockerized application.

## How to deploy

After project creation, a **private key is created**.
You can show this key with : 
```bash
project-show-key <projet?>
```

- Set this key in your **CI secrets** as `DEPLOY_KEY` to be able to deploy with `pasta ci`
- You can also set it as `.pasta.key` in your repository if you need **data synchronisation**, or direct push without CI
